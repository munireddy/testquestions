/*Q4: Implement a singleton C++ class.*/

/*
1. Define a private static attribute in the 'single instace' class
2. Define a public static accessor function in the class
3. Do "lazy initialization" in the acessor function
4. Define all constructors to be protected or private
5. Clients may only use the accessor function to manipulate the Singleton
6. Inheritance can be supported, but static function may not be overriden.
   The base class  must be delcared a friend of the derived class (in order to access the protected constructor)
